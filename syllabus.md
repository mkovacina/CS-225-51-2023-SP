# Policies

*Policy on Class Attendance*  
Class attendance is required as part of this course. You will be awarded one point for every class period in which you are present – not counting exam days or days that class is canceled.  These points are *extra* points.  Missing class will not count against you.  If you need to miss class, it is your responsibility to figure out what you missed by either looking at the scribed notes or talking to your fellow students.  

Should you need to miss class, I ask that you let me know ahead of time so that we can plan to make sure you don't miss anything.

Attendance will be taken at every class period. 

*Policy on Late Assignments*  
An assignment will be considered late if turned in after the end of the class period in which the assignment was due. Late assignments will be penalized by a percentage reduction of 5% of the total grade for each day they are late. 

*Policy on the Documentation and Accommodation of Disabilities*  
In accordance with federal law, if you have a documented disability you may request accommodations from Student Accessibility Services (SAS). For more information go to the [accessibility page](https://jcu.edu/accessibility) or you may contact the office directly at sas@jcu.edu or 216.397.4967. Please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive so it is best to register at the beginning of each semester.  Only accommodations approved by SAS will be recognized in the classroom.  Please contact SAS if you have further questions.

*Academic Honesty*

For the full JCU policy on academic honesty, please see the section on Academic Honesty in the Undergraduate Bulletin (https://www.jcu.edu/about-us/administrative-offices/dean-of-students/student-conduct-community-standards).

Academic honesty, expected of every student, is essential to the process of education and to upholding high ethical standards. Cheating, including plagiarism, inappropriate use of technology, or any other kind of unethical behavior, may subject the student to severe academic penalties ranging from zero on the assignment to failure of the class. 

All work submitted for evaluation in a course, including tests, term papers, and computer programs, must represent only the work of the student unless indicated otherwise. Material taken from the work of others must be acknowledged. Materials submitted to fulfill requirements in one course may not be submitted in another course without prior approval of the instructor(s). 

Concerns about the propriety of obtaining outside assistance and acknowledging sources should be addressed to the instructor of the course before the work commences and as necessary as the work proceeds.

*Policy on Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Bias*

John Carroll University is committed to fostering an equitable and accessible learning and working environment, based upon open communication, mutual respect, and ethical values consistent with our Jesuit and Catholic tradition. We express this commitment in the following policies and procedures:

In accordance with federal law, if you have a documented disability you may request accommodations from Student Accessibility Services (SAS). For more information go to the accessibility page or you may contact the office directly at sas@jcu.edu or 216.397.4967. Please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive so it is best to register at the beginning of each semester.  Only accommodations approved by SAS will be recognized in the classroom.  Please contact SAS if you have further questions.

If you have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or misconduct based upon gender/sex/sexual orientation, and you share this with a faculty or staff member, that person must notify the Title IX Coordinator (TitleIX@jcu.edu or (216) 397-1559), who will discuss options with you. In most cases, communicating with the Title IX Coordinator does not automatically trigger a formal investigation. Members of the University community may communicate with the Title IX Coordinator in order to get more information and seek supportive measures without filing a formal complaint. 

For more information about your options and resources in a Title IX matter, please go to the Title IX page, where you can file an online report. An option to report anonymously is available. Members of the University community are encouraged to review the University's Sexual Harassment & Interpersonal Violence Policy, as well as the Resolution Process & Grievance Process for Title IX Sexual Harassment.

If you have experienced bias or discrimination based on race, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, ethnic or national origin, disability, military or veteran status, genetic information, or any factor protected by law, you are encouraged to report this via the Bias Reporting System.
