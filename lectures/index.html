						## Welcome to CS225 
						## Web Programming 
						
						Mike Kovacina
						
						mkovacina@jcu.edu

						216.317.6585

						Notes:
						1. The goal of this class is to give you and overview of the tools and technologies of web Programming
						2. Subgoal of giving you a foundation for your career
							1. this area is still young and moving fast, must faster than other areas (e.g., algorithms)
						3. instructor background

						# Class Structure
						
						- primarily lecture based with live examples
						- relevant homework
						- scribing
						- you are adults...

						Notes:
						I tend towards the philosophical side but try to balance with tactical

						Never had this class (though my brother did), so you won't get as much "back in the day" about JCU, though
						you might get some about technology in general

						I don't know everything but am open to all questions

						Collaboration is encouraged...just don't copy.  Be adults.  It's okay to ask for help (me or others).

						# A note on communication

						- Not all communication methods are created equal
						
						- Email: if you need an answer...eventually
						- Phone: eww, I know, but if you need an answer NOW
						- IM: asynchronously interactive, if you need an answer soon-ish or "now"
						- Texting: need an answer now

						Notes:
						Some of this is cultural
						Some of this is institutional
						This isn't a hard and fast rule, but it applies pretty generally

							# What is DevOps?
							
							> DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domain of physical manufacturing and IT to the IT value stream 
							
							[DevOps Handbook, p.4](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=devops+handbook&qid=1630131913&sr=8-1)
							Notes:
							---
							# What is DevOps?
							> DevOps is a software development practice that promotes collaboration between development and operations, resulting in faster and more reliable software delivery. Commonly referred to as a culture, DevOps connects people, process, and technology to deliver continuous value.
							
							[Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/devops-tutorial/)
							---
							# "Dev"
							- Waterfall
								- upfront planning
								- deliver when done
							- Agile
								- iterative
								- deliver along the way
							Notes: 
							- Rooted in agile
							- Waterfall was not responsive to changes.
								- this isn't manufacturing where changes had physical cost (this cuts both ways)
							- Agile, will touch more on in a later class
							---
							# "Ops"
							![the assembly line](assets/images/assembly-line.jpg)

							> “What gets measured gets managed.” (Peter Drucker)
							Notes:
							- Henry Ford effectively operationalized the assembly line
							- neither development nor operations is a linear assembly
							- measuring is required for improvement
							- question: what can you measure?
								- quality (Defect rate), performance, cost, speed, ROM satisfaction (happy or not)

							# Why DevOps?
							## Value 
							>  ...the importance, worth, or usefulness of something... (OED)

							Notes:
							- if your customer never gets their value, you never get paid
							---
							# Why DevOps?
							![over the fence](assets/images/over-the-fence.jpg)
							Notes:
							- still following an assembly line mentality 
							- corporations split into silos with budgets and individual agendas
							---
							# The Cast of Characters
							- developers
							- testers/quality assurance (QA)
							- operations (IT)
							- product owners 
							- "management"
							- customers
							Notes:
							- question: name some examples of customers 
							---
							# Example problems
							- the developers never installed their software
							- the developers never tested their software
								- at all
								- on production hardware
								- at scale with load
							- development delays put a crunch on operations
							- what the software does isn't what the customer wants
							---
							# Feedback Loops
							
							![feedback loops](assets/images/feedback-loops.png)
							 Notes:
							 - yes, increasing communication means you need to get better at it...continually
							---
							# Feedback Loops
							
							![forward spiral](assets/images/forward-spiral.png)
							 Notes:
							 - feedback is what drives improvement
							 - the impossible goal of perfection

							# How DevOps?
							> Form follows function (Louis Sullivan)

							> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. (Melvin Conway)
							
							Notes:
							- sullivan was an architect, 19th century
							---
							# When to start?
							- if not at the start, then now
							- debt is real	
								- tech, product, security...
							Notes:
							- the world is rarely ideal, even at a startup (constraints)
							- the debts are variations on the same theme of value
							---
							# Transformations
							- it is difficult to turn a big ship
							- build a coalition up, down, and across your organization
							- work for an agreed upon understanding of the value delivered
							- identify a target state
							- identify transition transition states 
							- iterate, measure, adapt
							- avoid the temptation of cynicism :)

						# Markdown

						- yet another markup language
							- YAML is actually a thing, avoid it :)
						- intended to be more human friendly than HTML (i.e., readable)
						- very popular, embedded in many products
